RDFArchitect is a web-based tool for visualizing, editing, and sharing RDFS schemas with CIM extensions - as used in CGMES and the ENTSO-e network code profiles — along with their SHACL constraints.

It is an open source alternative to proprietary CIM/RDF modeling tools.

## Overview

RDFArchitect combines a Java/Spring backend and a Svelte frontend to provide a practical modeling workflow for CIM-based RDF schemas. The application supports importing, editing, sharing, comparing, validating, and exporting schemas with an interactive UI.

Diagrams can be easily shared as a complete, browsable reference of classes, relations, attributes, enumerations, notes, and SHACL shapes - no modeling tool or download required.

## Screenshots

The main editor combines schema navigation, package-focused diagram rendering, and context-sensitive actions for importing, versioning, and validation.

Class editing stays close to the model: labels, packages, inheritance, attributes, associations, enum entries, comments, and class-specific SHACL constraints are all available from the same workspace.

RDFArchitect also supports release workflows such as schema comparison, change review, and SHACL inspection without leaving the application.

## Key Features

- Import and export RDF schemas and CIM extensions
- Visualize class structures via UML diagrams
- Edit classes, attributes, associations, enum entries, and notes
- Share diagrams as a complete, read-friendly reference of classes, relations, notes, and constraints
- Schema migration between CIM versions and extensions
- Compare schemas and inspect change history
- Comprehensive SHACL support:
  - Generate SHACL rules covering everything in the schema
  - Import and manage custom SHACL shapes
  - Inspect shapes in context - directly on their target classes and properties

## Architecture

- Backend: Spring Boot service in `backend/` (default runtime port `8080`)
- Frontend: SvelteKit app in `frontend/` (dev server on `1407`)
- Gateway (local Docker): Nginx proxy in `docker/docker-compose.yaml` exposed on `3000`
  - `/` routes to frontend
  - `/api` routes to backend

## Prerequisites

- Java 25 or higher
- Maven 3.9.9 or higher
- Node.js 24 or higher
- npm 11 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized local setup)

## Quickstart

### Run Locally (Dev)

1. Start backend:

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

2. Start frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Open the frontend at `http://localhost:1407`.

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration Highlights

Backend config (`backend/src/main/resources`):

- `frontend.url` (default: `http://localhost:1407`)
- `frontend.accessRoute` (default: `/api`)
- `database.http.endpoint` (default: `http://localhost:3030`)
- `database.defaultDataset` (default: `default`)

Frontend runtime config:

- `PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` controls API base URL (Docker default: `/api`)
- In container deployments, this is injected via `frontend/docker-entrypoint.sh`

## API Documentation

When the backend is running, Swagger UI is available at:

- `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

## Development Workflows

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
mvn -B spotless:apply
mvn -B -Plint -DskipTests verify
mvn -B test
mvn -B verify
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run clean-install
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
