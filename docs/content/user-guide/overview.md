# User Guide

A practical walkthrough of RDFArchitect for people who work with **CIM/CGMES** and the **ENTSO-E Network Code Profiles**, but who do not want to write code.

RDFArchitect is a browser-based editor for **RDFS schemas with CIM extensions** and their **SHACL constraints**. It is designed around the daily work of the CIM community: importing a profile, inspecting its package and class structure, making controlled changes, validating against SHACL, comparing releases, planning a migration, and sharing the result.

This guide assumes you have the application running. If you don't, see [Installation](/admin-guide/installation).

## Core concepts in 2 minutes

Before the tour, three terms do a lot of work in RDFArchitect and it is worth fixing them up front.

**Dataset.** A dataset is the outermost container. Think of it as a "workspace" on the underlying triple store. A typical setup has one dataset called `default`, plus one dataset per snapshot that has been shared. Every import, every graph, every change is scoped to exactly one dataset.

**Graph (schema).** Inside a dataset, each **schema** lives in its own named graph. When you import a CGMES profile — say, `EquipmentProfile_v3.0.0.rdf` — that profile becomes *one graph* inside the dataset. You can have many graphs side-by-side in the same dataset (e.g. EQ, TP, SSH, SV profiles of a CGMES release), and you can move between them from the navigation tree on the left.

**Package.** Inside a graph, classes are grouped into UML-style packages (e.g. `Core`, `Wires`, `Generation::Production`). Packages are the first-class organisational unit for the diagram area: when you select a package, the centre canvas draws exactly the classes that belong to it, with associations to classes in other packages shown at the boundary.

The rest of the editor is built on top of those three. The navigation tree reads *"Dataset → Graph → Package → Class"*, and almost every action you trigger is implicitly scoped by what you have selected in that tree.
