# The Workspace and Importing Data

## The workspace

The main editor, reachable from the **Open Editor** button on the homepage or via the top navigation, is split into three panels:

- **Left — navigation tree.** Datasets, graphs inside each dataset, and packages inside each graph. Classes live under their packages and can be opened from here.
- **Centre — diagram canvas.** A UML-style class diagram of the currently selected package: classes with their attributes and associations, inheritance arrows, and links that leave the package. The diagram is rendered with SvelteFlow by default and supports pan, zoom, and auto-layout; a Mermaid rendering is also available.
- **Right — class editor.** When a class is selected, its full definition is available here: label, URI namespace, package, super class, stereotypes, comment, attributes, associations, enum entries, and class-level SHACL.

Across the top there is a **menu bar** (File, Edit, View, Help), a **search bar** for finding classes/attributes/packages across datasets, and indicators for read-only status and unsaved changes.

A colour legend and classic diagram conventions are used throughout: stereotypes like `«enumeration»` or `«Primitive»` appear above the class name, cardinalities are shown on association ends, and inheritance uses a hollow triangle.

## Getting data into RDFArchitect

There are three ways content lands in the editor.

### Import a schema (File → Import → Schema (RDFS))

This is the standard entry point for CGMES profiles and ENTSO-E Network Code Profiles. Pick a dataset (existing or a new name), drop in an `.rdf`, `.ttl`, or `.nt` file, and the contents become a graph inside that dataset. The graph name defaults to a sanitised version of the filename but can be overridden. If the target dataset has been set to read-only, the import is blocked until editing is re-enabled.

Supported input formats are **RDF/XML (.rdf)**, **Turtle (.ttl)**, and **N-Triples (.nt)**. CGMES releases are typically shipped as RDF/XML and can be imported directly.

### Import a SHACL file (File → Import → Constrains (SHACL))

A separate import path for custom SHACL shapes. These are stored *next to* the schema graph and can later be viewed from the same UI as the generated SHACL (see [SHACL](./shacl)).

### Create an empty schema (Edit → New → Schema (RDFS))

Starts a new, empty graph in the selected dataset. Useful when you want to build a small extension profile from scratch rather than import one.

Once a schema is imported, it becomes the active graph and the navigation tree on the left updates to show its packages.
