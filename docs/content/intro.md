# RDFArchitect

**RDFArchitect** is an open-source, web-based tool for visualizing, editing, validating, and sharing RDFS schemas with **CIM** extensions — as used in **CGMES** and the **ENTSO-E** network code profiles — together with their **SHACL** constraints.

It provides a practical modeling workflow for CIM-based RDF schemas without requiring a desktop modeling tool, license server, or RDF expertise from every team member who needs to read or review the model.

## What can you do with it?

- **Import** RDFS, OWL, and SHACL files (Turtle, RDF/XML, N-Triples, etc.) into a managed dataset.
- **Edit** classes, attributes, associations, enumerations, and notes through a UML-style diagram editor.
- **Validate** schemas using both auto-generated and hand-written SHACL shapes.
- **Compare** two schema versions side-by-side and review changes at the package, class, and property level.
- **Migrate** instance data from one schema version to the next via a guided wizard.
- **Share** read-only snapshots so reviewers can browse a schema without installing anything.
- **Track** every change in a per-graph changelog, with undo, redo, and version restore.

## Who is it for?

| Role | Why you care |
| ---- | ------------ |
| **Power-system / electrical engineers** | Read, navigate, and review CIM-based schemas without a heavyweight UML tool. |
| **Information modelers / data architects** | Author RDFS classes, attributes, associations, and SHACL constraints with full versioning and comparison. |
| **Project managers / product owners** | Inspect snapshots, comment on diagrams, and compare profile versions during release reviews. |
| **Developers** | Build on a Spring-Boot/SvelteKit codebase that exposes a clean REST API and is documented end-to-end. |
| **Administrators** | Deploy via Docker Compose, point at a Fuseki triple store, and integrate access control via a reverse proxy. |
